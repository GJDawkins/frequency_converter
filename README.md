__Frequency Converter__
This is a simple frequency converter application built using the tkinter library in Python. It allows you to convert frequencies between different units such as Hz, kHz, MHz, and GHz.

__Conversion Factors__
The conversion dictionary contains the conversion factors for different unit conversions. The keys are in the format of "from_unit_to_to_unit".

__Usage__
Run the code to open the application window.
Enter the frequency value in the "Enter the frequency" entry field.
Enter the current unit of the frequency in the "Enter the current unit" entry field. Valid units are "Hz", "kHz", "MHz", and "GHz".
Enter the desired unit of the frequency in the "Enter the desired unit" entry field. Valid units are the same as the current unit.
Click the "Convert" button to perform the conversion.
The conversion result will be displayed in a messagebox.
Note: The application will display error messages if you provide invalid inputs or conversion units.

__Dependencies__
This code requires the tkinter library to be installed. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip install tkinter.
